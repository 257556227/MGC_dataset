# Multimodal music genre classification
The dataset of the our paper "Music Genre Classification Based on Fusing Audio and Lyric Information"

## Dataset
We presented the MMGC Dataset, which is a new open dataset for multimodal music genre classification. To obtain an audio and lyric dataset, we retrieved and downloaded songs from music websites using song and song title information from the MetroLyrics dataset on Kaggle. The dataset contains 5,000 songs from folk, metal, country, hip-hop and jazz. We provided raw audio in mp3 format, the extracted audio features and the corresponding lyrics dataset.

### This dataset will be published after our paper is accepted.
