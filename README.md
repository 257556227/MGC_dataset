# MGC_hybrid fusion Dataset
We present the MGC Hybrid Fusion Dataset, a new open dataset for music genre classification. We built the dataset ourselves, which is the corresponding songs retrieved and downloaded from music websites using the songs from the mertroLyrics dataset on Kaggle and the song title information. The dataset contains 5,000 songs from folk, metal, country, hip-hop and jazz. We provide raw audio in mp3 format, the extracted audio features and the corresponding lyrics dataset.

### This data set will be published after our paper is received.
